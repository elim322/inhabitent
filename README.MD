## What I learned 

This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding in using WordPress and navigating through the template heirarchy. It was confusing at first but as I worked through it, it became more clear. Working with WordPress also taught me how powerful WordPress backend actually is especially with the use of Gutenberg and multiple plugins and widgets that gave me more flexibility in building the website. 

As of submission there are a few minor errors as the project is quite large, however I will continue to work towards a 100% completion for the project.
